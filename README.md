For implementation details, please refer to our paper: http://lab.plopes.org/#harvesting-haptics

- schematics: circuits used on PCB.
- code: containing Arduino code for NRF controller, Python code for connecting to NRF controller, and Processing code for intermediate program communicating to any Unity application (VR).
- waterjet: mounting plates and the big gear were cut using a waterjet machine, with 3mm Aluminum. Parts are assembled using M2 and M3 screws, mounted on elbow brace (MOSCARE).
- 3D printing: three gears are 3D printed with PLA.

## additional materials

- NRF52840 Dongle
- harvester (ZSFD-F1HD)
- electro-permanent magnet: Alnico Grade 5 soft magnet + 28 AWG coil
- neodymium magnets
- 8mm bearing
- 5mm ABS shafts
